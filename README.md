# Energy forecaster

## Aim of this project
The goal of this project is to forecast the electricity consumption in France and display it to the user.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the different packages.

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy pystan fbprohet pickle
```

## Usage

Currently the display isn't working. I wanted to use Streamlit and its free deployment but apparently my app excedes the limitation of the free tier.
But you can use it locally on your machine :

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```
